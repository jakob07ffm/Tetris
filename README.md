# Tetris

## Overview

This project is made with Love2D. The game features traditional Tetris mechanics including block rotation, line clearing, and score tracking. As the game progresses, the speed increases based on the level, making it more challenging.

## Features

- **Grid-based Gameplay**: A 10x20 grid where tetrominoes (shapes) are placed and cleared.
- **Shape Rotation**: Players can rotate tetrominoes to fit them into the grid.
- **Ghost Piece**: A shadow of the current tetromino is displayed to indicate where it will land.
- **Scoring and Levels**: Players earn points by clearing lines, and the game speeds up as they progress through levels.
- **Game Over and Restart**: The game ends when tetrominoes stack to the top, with an option to restart.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**:
  - **Left/Right**: Move the tetromino left or right.
  - **Up**: Rotate the tetromino clockwise.
  - **Down**: Soft drop (increases falling speed temporarily).
- **Spacebar**: Hard drop (instantly drop the tetromino to the ghost piece position).
- **R Key**: Restart the game after a game over.
